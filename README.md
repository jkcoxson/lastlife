Recently many Minecraft YouTubers have started playing a game called Last Life. I have ported the game purely from watching the videos to a Fabric mod, including some of my own optional twists and ease of use configurations.

 

In case you haven't heard of Last Life, here's a rundown of how the game is played.

 

# Game Summary

When you first join the game, you will be given a random amount of lives. Every time you die, you lose one life. Once you are out of lives it's game over; you can no longer join the server.

The objective is to be the last man standing, in this Battle Royale style gameplay. But watch out, there's a twist. 

Every configurable interval, a 'boogieman' will be chosen randomly from the player base. This 'boogieman' must kill another player before the next time interval, or they will lose a life!

 

# Optional Extra Features

Chat Radius: only users within a configurable distance from each other will be able to use the in game chat. Just like in real life, you can't talk over the whole world.

Player Base Lock: once all the players have joined, you can lock the server from letting anyone else join new.

Inactivity Penalty: if someone hasn't gotten on during the boogieman interval, they will lose a life. This is to stop people from avoiding the risk of logging on.

Murder Penalty: if a player kills another player, they will lose a life as well unless it is the boogieman.

Boogieman Reward: earn an extra life by hunting and killing the boogieman (amoogus style)
